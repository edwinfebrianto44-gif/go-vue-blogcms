## üîß Verification Commands

### SSL/TLS Verification
```bash
# Test SSL configuration
curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com
curl -I https://app.yourdomain.com

# Check SSL Labs rating
# Visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

# Verify certificate expiration
openssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.yourdomain.com/cert.pem -noout -dates
```

### Security Verification
```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status verbose

# Verify fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..15}; do curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com/health; done

# Check security headers
curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com | grep -E "(Strict-Transport|X-Frame|X-Content|X-XSS)"
```

### Backup Verification
```bash
# Check backup files
ls -la /opt/blogcms/backups/

# Verify S3 backups
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket/backups/

# Test backup restoration (in staging)
# gunzip -c backup.sql.gz | mysql -u user -p database
```

### Health Verification
```bash
# Application health
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/healthz
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/readyz
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health

# Container health
docker-compose -f /opt/blogcms/docker-compose.production.yml ps
```

## üö® Security Incident Response

### Immediate Actions
1. **Identify the threat**
   - Check application logs
   - Review fail2ban logs
   - Monitor unusual traffic patterns

2. **Contain the incident**
   - Block malicious IPs via fail2ban
   - Scale down affected services if needed
   - Preserve evidence for analysis

3. **Assess the damage**
   - Check for unauthorized access
   - Verify data integrity
   - Review audit logs

4. **Recovery procedures**
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Rotate all secrets and passwords
   - Update and patch systems

5. **Post-incident review**
   - Document the incident
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement additional safeguards

### Emergency Contacts
```bash
# System administrator
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@yourdomain.com"

# Security team
SECURITY_EMAIL="security@yourdomain.com"

# Emergency procedure
echo "Security incident detected at $(date)" | mail -s "URGENT: Security Alert" $SECURITY_EMAIL
```
