# Phase 16 â€” Performance & UX Polish

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. **Gzip/Brotli compression** in Nginx for better asset delivery
2. **Cache-control headers** for static assets optimization
3. **Code splitting & lazy loading** for non-critical routes
4. **Skeleton/loading states** for lists and detail views
5. **Lighthouse audit** achieving Performance â‰¥ 90

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

- **Bundle size reduction** through code splitting
- **Improved TTI (Time to Interactive)** 
- **Smooth UX** with loading states and transitions
- **Better Core Web Vitals** scores
